Sometime I get asked how to learn computational methods, and there is quite a lot of great, **free** reading material and tools to get you started (or go further).

## Great Free Textbooks

In my opinion, these are probably the best books on *Machine Learning* that I've read and highly recommend them.

1. I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, A. Courville (2016). Deep Learning. MIT Press. http://www.deeplearningbook.org
2. D. MacKay (2012). Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms. Cambridge University Press. http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/
3. C. Bishop (2006). Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Springer. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf   

## Computational Tools

There are several Machine Learning software that is available in the market. Enlisted below are the most popular ones among them.

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
2. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
3. [Keras](https://keras.io/)
4. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

Typically, I use TensorFlow and Scikit Learn. I would recommend both as they have a lot of very reasonable defaults for most uses. PyTorch is also very good, **but** for those who want more control.
