## About Ioannis

Hi, I'm Ioannis. I'm a PhD student at the [Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hamlyn-centre/) and the [Department of Surgery and Cancer](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/department-surgery-cancer) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I'm working on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Medical Imaging for image-guided interventions and cancer diagnosis and treatment. I'm specially interested in using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to assist surgeons with the complete resection of tumours. More specifically I try to leverage the power of **Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI)** to provide non-invasive, tissue contact-free and real-time diagnosis.
