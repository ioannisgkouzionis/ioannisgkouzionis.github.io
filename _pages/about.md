## About Ioannis

Hi, I'm Ioannis. I'm a PhD student at the [Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hamlyn-centre/) and the [Department of Surgery and Cancer](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/department-surgery-cancer) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I'm working on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Medical Imaging for image-guided interventions and cancer diagnosis and treatment. I'm specially interested in using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to assist surgeons with the complete resection of tumours. More specifically I try to leverage the power of **Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI)** to provide non-invasive, tissue contact-free and real-time diagnosis during cancer surgery.

Previous I received my **Diploma of Engineering (Dipl.-Ing.)** in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Technical University of Crete](https://www.tuc.gr/index.php?id=4992) in 2017 and I completed my MSc thesis on *Machine Learning for the detection and classification of skin lesions in HSI* in 2019. I've worked as Research Intern at [IMEC](https://www.imec-int.com/en/home) where I conducted research on *Deep Learning for automated segmentation of neurons in confocal microscopy imaging*.

I use the Python programming language and command line tools to explore, analyse, visualise and present data. I also have a strong interest in reproducibility, scientific publishing workflows, and open data best practices. I'm excited to apply my computational skills in combination with my Biophotonics and HSI background to the study and early diagnosis of cancer.
