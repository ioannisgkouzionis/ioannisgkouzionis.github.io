Sometime I get asked how to learn computational methods, and there is quite a lot of great, **free** reading material and tools to get you started (or go further).

## A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning

**Data alone is not enough**

Machine learning is not magic; it can't get something from nothing. What is does is get more from less. When you work on a real Machine learning problem, you should focus your efforts on your *domain knowledge* and *data* before optimising your choice of algorithms. You should not rush into neural networks because you think they are cool. To improve your model, **get more data** and then use your knowledge of the problem to *explore and process* the data. You should optimise the choice of algorithms after you have gathered enough data and you've processed it well.

## Great Free Textbooks

In my opinion, these are probably the best books on *Machine Learning* that I've read and highly recommend them.

* I. Goodfellow, Y. Bengio, A. Courville (2016). *Deep Learning*. MIT Press. http://www.deeplearningbook.org
* S. Shalev-Shwartz, S. Ben-David (2014). *Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms*. Cambridge University Press. https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/copy.html
* C. Bishop (2006). *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*. Springer. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf 

### [[Recommended] Prof. Andrew Ng's *Machine Learning* course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 

The aforementioned is a very popular and esteemed **free** online course.

## Computational Tools

There are several Machine Learning software that is available in the market. Enlisted below are the most popular ones among them.

* [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

Typically, I use TensorFlow and Scikit Learn. I would recommend both as they have a lot of very reasonable defaults for most uses. PyTorch is also very good, **but** for those who want more control.

## Cheat Sheets

Some good cheat sheets I've came across.
